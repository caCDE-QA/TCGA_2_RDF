# TCGA_2_RDF

This project converts a spreadsheet containing TCGS data elements into RDF triples and writes them out to a turtle file.  There is a related project which puts REST services on top of the repository to retrieve the data elements.

The spreadsheet was created using the SQPARL queries found in the caDE-QA wiki
